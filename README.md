This is a simple Django polling application, based off of the official tutorial for Django 3.0. ( https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/ ) Steps 1-5 were completed, then additional functionality was added, such as:

- Name and date fields were added to the vote form, so that the user must sign and date each vote.
- Functionality was added to indicate correct and incorrect answers for a question. This is not mandatory; answers can still be neither. If the user chooses a correct or incorrect answer, an appropriate message will be shown after they submit their vote.
- A report page was added to each question. It shows the total number of votes submitted, as well as the number of correct and incorrect votes. It also displays information on the most recent vote cast.

The whole web application has been styled with Bootstrap ( https://getbootstrap.com/ ).
